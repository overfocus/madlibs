  text: `I {verb} a candidate's CV twice.

He applied for a third time so I invited him in for an interview.

‚Üí At our {location} {place} ‚úîÔ∏è

(We don't have a {location} {place})

Instead, I gave him the address of a well-known and extremely dangerous {danger} in the middle of {location}.

A place frequented day and night by:

‚Üí {group1} 
‚Üí {group2} 
‚Üí {group3} 

That was the last time he sent me his CV.

The lesson?

When it comes to business, insanity is doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results.

‚Üí You've got to get {lesson} ‚úîÔ∏è
